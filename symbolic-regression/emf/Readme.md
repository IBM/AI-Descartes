# How to modify the code and compile

One way to modify the code and create a new executable,
is to use Eclipse.
Eclipse can be downloaded [here](https://www.eclipse.org/).

The steps to modify the code and create a new executable in Eclipse are:
1. Install Eclipse.
2. Import the project emf into Eclipse.
3. Modify the code.
4. Create a new runnable JAR file in Eclipse by doing: 
   * From the menu bar's File menu, select Export.
   * Expand the Java node and select Runnable JAR file. Click Next.
   * In the Runnable JAR File Specification page, select a `Java Application` launch configuration to use to create a runnable JAR.
   * In the Export destination field, either type or click Browse to select a location for the JAR file.
   * Select an appropriate library handling strategy.
