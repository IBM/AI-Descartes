# DATA

This folder contains the data used for the paper:

| Folder | Content |
| --- | --- |
| FSRD | background theory and proof for 7 FSRD problems  |
| FSRD_noise | data points for 81 problems of FSRD resembling real data|
| kepler | data points for kepler problem, background theory and proof |
| langmuir | data points for langmuir problem, background theory and proof|
| relativistic_time_dilation | data points for relativistic time dilation problem, background theory and proof|

The data points for FSRD (Feynman Symbolic Regression Database)
 can be found here: https://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/aifeynman.html

The background theory for each problem is the minimal set necessary to prove the corresponding formula.
