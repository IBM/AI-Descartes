# DATA

This folder contains the data used for the paper:

| Folder | Content |
| --- | --- |
| FSRD | background theory for 7 FSRD problems  |
| FSRD_noise | data points for the 81 FSRD real-world problems generated from the FSRD dataset by adding noise and limiting the number of points to 10 (to resemble real data)|
| kepler | data points (`.dat` files) and background theory for Kepler's problem |
| langmuir | data points (`.dat` files) and background theory for Langmuir's problem |
| relativistic_time_dilation | data points (`.dat` files) and background theory for the Time-Dilation problem|

The original data points for FSRD (Feynman Symbolic Regression Database) 
can be found here: https://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/aifeynman.html

The background theory for each problem is the minimal set necessary to prove the corresponding formula.
